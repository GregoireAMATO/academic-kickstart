# Objectives
The main objective of the project is to build an application to generate spotify playlists according to some criteria. Another "technical" objective was to test the R/Python interconnectivity, and thus to build an application using both.

## Using the application

The application may take a little time to load completely, when it is fully loaded, you can select the playlist features you want, and the application will give you the corresponding playlists.

The application is available [here](https://camillephilippe.shinyapps.io/recommandation-playlist-spotify/).
